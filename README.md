### 课程介绍 | Course Introduction

CS229 是 Stanford University（斯坦福大学）给研究生开设的经典机器学习课程。本仓库整理的是 **2018 年秋季（Fall 2018）** 版本的相关资源，课程由 Andrew Ng 等讲授。该课程系统、完整地讲解了机器学习中常用方法的理论与实践，适合希望扎实掌握机器学习基础并能开展后续研究或工程实践的学习者。

课程教材／主要学习材料来源于授课老师与助教撰写的 **lecture notes**，里面对各个机器学习方法的理论推导非常齐全（缺失的推导通常在 homework 中要求完成）。课程既从数学（理论）角度也从实际应用角度讲解方法的由来与相互关联，逻辑清晰，叙述简明。

课程视频由 **Andrew Ng**（知名机器学习教育者）授课，内容与 lecture notes 基本一致。若时间有限，优先精读 lecture notes，不懂的再看视频以加深理解。除此之外，助教补充拓展了许多重要细节。

课程的重中之重是四次 homework：这些作业既巩固了已学知识，又要求学生从头或在一定基础上实现或推导机器学习算法，对将来从事相关研究或独立实践非常有帮助！课程同时会巩固线性代数（矩阵运算与 NumPy 使用）与数理统计的基础知识。当然，具备相关数学背景会更快上手。

### 课程学习建议 | Study Suggestions

* **优先阅读 Lecture Notes：** 内容完整、推导严谨，适合作为主材料。若对某一节不理解，再观看对应的视频讲解。
* **重视 Homework：** 四次作业是课程的核心练习，能训练从理论到实现的能力。认真完成每一道题，必要时参考助教/同学讨论。其中有 notebook 文件可以参考（感觉是官方答案，但不齐全）。
* **数学准备：** 强化线性代数（矩阵运算、特征分解、向量空间等）与概率统计基础，有助于更快理解课程内容。对 NumPy 的熟悉程度也会显著提高编程效率。

# CS229 Fall 2018 — Course Resources

### Course Introduction

CS229 is Stanford University's classic graduate-level course on machine learning. This repository collects resources for the **Fall 2018** offering, taught by Andrew Ng and others. The course provides a systematic and comprehensive treatment of commonly used machine learning methods, covering both theory and practice, and is well-suited for learners who want a solid foundation for research or engineering in machine learning.

The primary course materials come from the instructors' and TAs' **lecture notes**, which contain thorough theoretical derivations for most methods (any missing derivations are often required as part of the homework). The course explains the origins and interconnections of various methods from both mathematical (theoretical) and practical perspectives, with clear logic and concise exposition.

Lecture videos are delivered by **Andrew Ng** (a well-known machine learning educator), and largely align with the lecture notes. If you have limited time, focus on studying the lecture notes first and use the videos to clarify difficult topics. TA sessions provide additional important details and supplements.

A central component of the course is the four homework assignments: they not only reinforce previously learned material but also require students to derive or implement machine learning algorithms from scratch or from a solid base. Completing them is very helpful for future research or independent practice. The course also reinforces linear algebra (matrix operations and NumPy usage) and mathematical statistics — having this mathematical background will make it easier to get started.

### Study Suggestions

* **Prioritize the Lecture Notes:** They are comprehensive and rigorously derived, and suitable as the main study material. Watch the videos for clarification when needed.
* **Take the Homeworks Seriously:** The four homework assignments are the core exercises that train you from theory to implementation. Complete them carefully and consult TAs or peers if necessary. Some notebooks are available as references (they may resemble official solutions but are not always complete).
* **Mathematical Preparation:** Strengthen your linear algebra (matrix operations, eigen-decomposition, vector spaces) and probability/statistics foundations. Familiarity with NumPy will significantly improve coding efficiency.
