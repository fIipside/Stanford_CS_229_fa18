### Laplace Smoothing
- What do you do if the word is not in your dictionary? One approach: throw it away. The second: take the special word and map them to a special token which traditionally is denoted by UNK for unknown words.
- 'm0rtgage' : map the word to the way human see them. Spoof email headers implement something quick and dirty starting from Naive Bayes.
